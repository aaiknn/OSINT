# Aaiknn's OSINT
This is both a collection of information and knowledge on OSINT, and a repository of collections, materials, tools, how-tos on OSINT with all its various disciplines. It's a maintained project: The information in here will grow and change over time.

Note that dead links are generally not removed from the repository, but rather replaced by a link to a web archive snapshot. If you find a dead link behind an item that sparks your interest, try recovering the content by making use of web archiving.

## Note on the Markdown
The project is maintained using [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/), a clever and handy bit of technology that lets you just take your notes and get neither lost nor distracted in doing so. Most of the markdown that is used here is standard markdown, and a few bits and pieces are inherently based on features of Obsidian itself. Which is why not everything will render as intended in any markdown reader.
